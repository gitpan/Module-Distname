NAME
    Module::Distname - find out which dist (or dists) a module lives in

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Distname;
      my @dists = Module::Distname->dists('Test::More');
      print join(', ', @dists), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module works by searching the .packlist files installed by
    Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker and attempt to figure out the dist
    names from the file paths.

METHODS
    dists( module_name )
        Returns a hash of 'dist name' => 'version' mappings of all the
        currently-installed dists that contain the given module. Usually
        this would be a one-element hash. However, if the module is core it
        will also be in the 'Perl' dist. If a version cannot be determined,
        an empty string will be in its place.

        This method will croak if it cannot load the given module.

BUGS
    *   This module relies on .packlists and will not work if these are not
        present.

    *   It can be argued that the functionality of this module should be
        rolled into ExtUtils::Installed.
